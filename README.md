Design:

Colour Scheme - The two main colours used are black and white. I chose the black and white colours to allow the colours of the images I was going to use to really pop.

Typography - With this project visually I wanted to keep things as simple as possible. I knew that the images I had planned to use in the project were very busy so I wanted to keep the rest as unfussy as possible. So I chose the Garamond font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Garamond is a clean and classy font used to add a layer of sophistication to the site whilst also offering clear and easily read text.

Imagery - The images used on this site were the building blocks for what I wanted to achieve visually. I wanted to incorporate as many images as I could to give potential employers a view of the performers range of characters and experience at a moments glance. I wanted this project to be a snapshot of her brand, so I wanted the whole site to be somewhat like a brochure.  I like the accessibility of a brochure. Everything you need to know at a moments glance. So with this brochure style idea in mind I put that first title, head shot picture at the top to articulate who she was and what she was about, then followed on with the back and forth across the page that included the about, media and gallery sections. Followed then by a very clear and concise place to make contact right at the bottom of the page. A quick snapshot of what Maria Hughes Soprano can do. The first image you see is a large media shot of the performer. It gives a quick introductary snap of what to expect in the rest of the website. When you scroll down you come to the "About" section. Here you are greeted with a performance picture of the performer and a short bio. These are laid out side by side to give the viewer a concise intro and vision of the performer on the stage. Scroll further and you come to the "Media" section. Here you are given two clickable links to audio files. There is also a promo shot picture alongside. When doing any external links I always made sure to use the "_blank" target so as to open in a new page and not draw the user away from the main focus of my page. Continue scrolling and you come to a gallery section. Here you see six pictures that include performance pictures, promo shots and headshots. They were chosen to show a variety of the performers abilities and looks. The final scroll brings you to a very simple contact form. I really like the use of the thick black boarders I used around my headings and contact file. I feel like it gives a little lift of animation and gives the project quite an edgy feel to it.

Features

- Nav Bar : This is located at the top of the page at all times. I achieved this by using the bootstrap class of "fixed-top". In the navbar on the left is a h4 with a name and title. On the right I have put the four section headings with clickable anchor href links to each section.
- Title Section : This section has a title headshot with a name and title again.
- About Section : In this section is a short biography and a performance picture of Maria Hughes Soprano with the title "About".
- Media Section: In this section again there is a promo picture of Maria Hughes with the title "Media" along with clickable links to youtube videos containing sound clips of Maria singing and a promotion clip of a performance of Carmen performed by Opera Theatre Company.
- Gallery Section : This section contains some performamce pictures and headshots from various productions Maria has done through the years.
- Footer : This section is used more so for the asthetic of the project. I feel that thick black line really finishes off the overall look of the whole site.
- Its responsive on all device sizes.



Existing Features

 - Clicking "About" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the about section.
 - Clicking "Media" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the media section.
 - Clicking "Gallery" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the gallery section.
 - Clicking "Contact" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the contact section.
 - Within the media section there are two icons buttons that if you click on them brings you to external youtube links to listen to a sound file of Maria.
 - Within the contact section there is an option to fill in a contact form that has options to put in your name, email address and leave a message. By clicking on the "get in touch" button this then sends your message and information to Maria.

Future Features

- In the future I might introduce a clickable feature to social media accounts. 
- Also as Maria's career develops I will be adding more up to date information along with new images and media.

Testing

- Throughout this entire project my go to for checking errors in my code was W3C Markup Validation Service: https://validator.w3.org/ . I am able to copy my HTML code into this to flag an errors I might have along the way. This includes a final check before finalising a project.

Deployment

- As my Github and Gitpod are linked I was able to create a repository for my project in Github and open it in the Gitpod workspace. 
- Whilst working through my project I frequently saved my work to the Gitpod workspace so it was being saved there (by clicking on Ctrl and S or going to file and clicking on save) and I could open that workspace and my work was saved. This process was necessary in order to be able to run your code in the browser and see your running page. 
- I also was able to save my work to Github by going through a series of steps. 
    1. In the terminal workspace I typed "git add" and then clicked return. 
    2. I then typed "git commit -m "commit message" " and again clicked return.
    3. The final step to save your work to Github is to type "git push" and finally click return. Your work is then saved to Github hosting platform.
